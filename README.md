# TipTimeApp
The Tip Time app has all the UI needed for a tip calculator, code to calculate the tip. There's a Calculate button. The Cost of Service EditText allows the user to enter the cost of the service. A list of RadioButtons lets the user select the tip percentage, and a Switch allows the user to choose whether the tip should be rounded up or not. The tip amount is displayed in a TextView, and finally a Calculate Button will tell the app to get the data from the other fields and calculate the tip amount. 
This app was created by me in the learning process of the "Android Basics in Kotlin" course provided by Google.
